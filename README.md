# **CSEL302- Introduction to Intelligent Systems**

## **Introduction**
  > Welcome to my CSEL302 Webpage! CSEL302 is the Introduction to Intelligent Agents course I'm currently taking under Mr. Mark Bernardino. Below is a compilation of all assigned activities, and bits of info relating most notably to Linear and Logistic Regression, two techniques used in predictive modelling that allows us to have valuable insights into datasets.

## **Introduction to AI and Intelligent Agents**
>AI refers to the intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence possessed by humans and animals.

>It encompasses a wide range of techniques and technologies that enable machines to perceive, learn, reason, solve problems, and act autonomously.

## **Data Analysis and Visualization**
### Data Processing
> Data collection is the process of gathering information. Just like collecting different types of toys or stamps, data collection involves bringing together pieces of information from various sources. This information could be anything from survey responses and observations to measurements and interviews.
### Data Preprocessing
> Data preprocessing is the process of getting your data ready for analysis or machine learning by cleaning, organizing, and formatting it. It involves tasks like removing errors, dealing with missing information, and making sure the data is in a usable form. Think of it as preparing ingredients before cooking – you want them clean and well-prepared for the best results. In data analysis, having clean and well-organized data ensures accurate and meaningful insights.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
> It is a critical process in data analysis, and it serves as the initial step before diving into more in-depth analysis or modeling. It helps:


1.   Understand Data
2. Identify Patterns
3. Detect Anomalies
4. Formulate Hypotheses
5. Guide Decision-Making
6. Communicate Insights


### Data Visualization Tools
- Matplotlib is like a versatile artist's toolkit for creating all sorts of charts and graphs. It's as if you have a canvas, and Matplotlib provides you with brushes and colors to paint your data.
- Seaborn is like a stylist that makes your data look fashionable. It's built on top of Matplotlib and adds some extra beauty and ease to your visualizations.

## **Probability and Statistics**
### Probability
>Probability implies 'likelihood' or 'chance'. When an event is certain to happen then the probability of occurrence of that event is 1 and when it is certain that the event cannot happen then the probability of that event is 0.

### Probability Distributions
> A probability distribution describes the likelihood of each possible outcome for a random variable. It tells us how probable each value is and provides a complete picture of the random variable's behavior.

### Descriptive Statistics
- Mean (Average): It's the sum of all values divided by the number of values.
- Median: It's the middle value when data is sorted, or the average of the two middle values if there's an even number of values.
- Variance: It quantifies the spread or dispersion of data points from the mean.
- Standard Deviation: It's the square root of the variance and measures the average deviation from the mean.

## **Linear Regression**
